# School District Analysis - <i>PyCitySchools</i>

## Project Overview
The school board wanted summary data reported for their district and provided school and student data for analysis.<br>
We have provided the analysis of the data to their specifications.<br><br>
Subsequently, they have discovered that the 9th grade scores for one school, Thomas High School, are suspect.<br>
The School Board wants to have the analysis redone, excluding these scores. <br>
Additionally, they want to know how the overall analysis is affected by omitting the dubious scores.
