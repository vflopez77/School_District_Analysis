# School District Analysis - <i>PyCitySchools</i>

## Project Overview
The School Board wanted summary data reported for their district and provided school and student data for analysis.<br>
We have provided the analysis of the data to their specifications.<br><br>
Subsequently, they have discovered that the 9th grade scores for one school, Thomas High School, are suspect.<br>
The School Board wants to have the analysis redone, excluding these scores. <br>
Additionally, they want to know how the overall analysis is affected by omitting the dubious scores.<br><br>

### The analysis of the School District Data included these elements:
- A District Summary
- Key metrics for each school
- Average math and reading scores by students in each grade level at each school
- Passing percentage for math and reading
- Overall passing percentage (both math and reading)
- Top 5 and bottom 5 schools based on overall passing rate
- School performance by budget per student
- School performance based on school size
- School performance based on the type of school (District or Charter)

## Effect of Data Exclusion
### District Summary Report
<b>District Summary Report Before:</b><br>

<b>District Summary Report After:</b><br>

The District Summary Report showed a lower average math score (78.9 vs 79.0) after the change in the data.<br>

### School Summary Report
<b>School Summary Report Before:</b><br>

<b>School Summary Report After:</b><br>

The School Summary Report showed a lower average math score, higher average reading score, lower passing math percentage, lower passing reading percentage, and lower overall passing percentage after the change in the data.
